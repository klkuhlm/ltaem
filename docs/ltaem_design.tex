The LT-AEM is able to compute the solution to different PDEs that can
be cast into a similar form as the Laplace-transformed diffusion
equation.  Of most concern for groundwater is the inclusion of various
homogeneous source terms, like the effects of neighboring leaky
aquifers, unconfinedness, and dual porosity.

The original diffusion equation is defined in terms of 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  q^2 = \frac{p}{\alpha}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha=K/S_s$ is aquifer diffusivity.  

\subsection{Leaky}
In the case of leakiness, the three cases considerd are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[I] no-drawdown condition at opposite side of finite aquitard
\item[II] no-flow condition at opposite side of finite aquitard
\item[III] aquitard thickness is semi-infinite
\end{enumerate}
Two leaky aquitards could be included, simply by including the two
types of terms required (and keeping track of both sets of
parameters).  These three source terms are:
\begin{align}
  q_{\mathrm{I}}^2 &= \frac{p}{\alpha} + \frac{p K_2}{\alpha_2 Kb} \frac{1 + \exp\left(-2 \frac{p b_2}{\alpha_2}\right)}{1 - \exp\left(-2 \frac{p b_2}{\alpha_2}\right)} \\
  q_{\mathrm{II}}^2 &= \frac{p}{\alpha} + \frac{p K_2}{\alpha_2 Kb} \frac{1 - \exp\left(-2 \frac{p b_2}{\alpha_2}\right)}{1 + \exp\left(-2 \frac{p b_2}{\alpha_2}\right)} \\
  q_{\mathrm{III}}^2 &= \frac{p}{\alpha} + \frac{p K_2}{\alpha_2 Kb} 
\end{align}
where a subscript $2$ indicates a property of the aquitard.  These
solutions are taken directly from the modified theory of leaky
aquifers. (Hantush, 1960).

\subsection{Unconfined}
Unconfined behavior analogous to Neuman (1972), can be obtained by
computing an integrated response (since Neuman's solution has an
explict $z$-coordinate), or by using the Boulton (1955) solution that
has no $z$ dependence.

\subsection{Dual Porosity}
Dual-porosity response assumes there are two overlapping domains, the
fractures and the matrix, each most generally with a diffusion-type
solution (Douherty and Babu, 1984).  Under the assumtion that $K_f \gg K_m$ the 3D diffusion in the matrix reduces to just 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \frac{\partial h_m}{\partial t} = \lambda \left( h_m - h_f\right)
\end{equation}
