The Laplace Transform Analytic Element Method (LT-AEM) introduced by Furman and Neuman (2003), is extended to include more types of elements. This method simulates transient groundwater flows and can calculate particle path lines using the Analytic Element method (AEM) approach to solving the modified Helmholtz equation in the Laplace domain. The result in Laplace space is back-transformed to the time domain using a Fourier Series numerical inverse Laplace transform method (de Hoog, et.al., 1982).

The method currently solves for the head and pore velocity distributions which result from a specified arrangement of point, line and circular area sources and sinks, potentially nested circular regions of different aquifer parameters, and circular specified head or flux areas.  All elements can have time-dependent behaviour, (e.g., piecewise constant in time pumping rates for a well, or sinusoidally varying areal recharge rates in time).  Different non-zero starting conditions can be specified in each circular element.  

The solution is obtained by matching the head and normal flux immediately inside and outside the circular boundary at points along circular elements. The effect which each circular element produces on the flow field is expressed in terms of generalized Fourier series coefficients, which converge rapidly in most cases (<10 terms). The matching is performed in Laplace space in a least-squares fashion (more matching points along the circles than Fourier series terms).   

This method is a natural extension of the traditional steady-state AEM to transient problems, allowing accurate, efficient calculation of groundwater flow in a mesh-free manner, with an increasing number of available elements and tools to work with.
